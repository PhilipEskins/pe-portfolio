## Process

#### 8/15/19
_Finished out the projects component and started work on Experiences._

#### 8/14/19
_Did some minor tweaks to the page. Added logo and moved css classes around to make the code drier._

#### 8/13/19
_Built out the framework for the project card and got a neat hover effect working._

#### 8/12/19
_Moved the scroll effect function up so I can pass it down to any component that might need it. Changed the background for the firstview and everybody seems to like it much better Made the content box a little transparent so people can see the picture behind it. Added the projects component back in to experiment with the scroll effect._

#### 8/9/2019
_Got the nice scroll effect working. Might need to move it up the tree so the other components can get access to the function. Will need to look into adding a fallback for the smooth scrolling in case someone views it on a browser that doesn't support it._

#### 8/7/2019
_Decided to ditch the star background as it had an early 2000's vibe to it. Will probably make this a single page site with the cool scroll effect._

#### 8/6/2019
_Made a new branch of v1.0 of the original site, decided to try something different and made a firstview component. Found a cool star background from this site https://1-background.com/stars_1.htm_

#### 8/5/2019
_Added React Router to the project. Created project and about components._

#### 8/4/2019
_Built out some basic framework for the site added picture and side nav bar._

#### 7/29/2019
_Started working on design of the website using Figma. Used create-react-app to generate a framework for the site._
